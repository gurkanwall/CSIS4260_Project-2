We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …” he wrote on X. Though there is no evidence of Musk’s claims beyond his word, it’s not farfetched to believe that his platform would be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Musk has become more prominent and controversial than ever under President Donald Trump’s second administration, as he has personally led his team called “DOGE” throughhaphazard cutsto government funding, jobs, and international aid programs. Tesla stores have also been subject toprotestsover Musk’s outsized, unelected role in the government, with thestock of Musk’s car companydropping as well. According toDowndetector, a website that tracks users’ reports of online outages, X went down for some users around 5:30 a.m. ET, with more than 20,000 users reporting outages. Though these outages seemed to have resolved after about an hour, the outages returned around 9:30 a.m. ET, with more than 40,000 users reporting issues. Though some users were able to access X intermittently, the issues continued past 1:30 PM ET. Occasional outages are normal for platforms of this size, but are never convenient for their users — as one user lamented in the comments on Downdetector, “on day 1 of the NFL free agency!? ELON Fix this.”  Topics Reporter Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Gemini will automatically detect calendar-related content in an email and present an “Add to calendar” button. After clicking the button, the side panel in Gmail will open to confirm the event has been added to the calendar. Google notes in a blog post that the feature is only available in English and on the web for now. A calendar event created via the “Add to calendar” button won’t include other guests, and it also won’t appear for emails with already-extract events, like restaurant and flight reservations. Users on Google Workspace Business and Enterprise tiers, as well as customers with a Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium plan, are eligible for the new feature. (Users who previously purchased the now-deprecated Gemini Business or Gemini Enterprise add-ons are also eligible.) Admins can enable “Add to calendar” by switching on smart features and personalization from the Workspace Admin console. “Add to calendar” is only the latest Gemini-powered tool to reach Gmail inboxes. In June 2024, Googleadded new capabilitiesto Gmail on the web to help users write emails and summarize email threads, plus ask questions and find specific information from emails within an inbox. Some of those capabilities came to the Gmail apps foriOSandAndroidtoward the end of last year.

The company told TechCrunch that Chief Financial Officer Stephanie Roberts will serve as interim CEO while the company searches for a replacement, and that Molyneux will serve as an adviser. The news, firstreportedby Electrek, comes a few months after it went through itsfifth round of layoffs in under four years. Molyneux took over the CEO role in 2022 after previous CEO Mike Radenbaugh stepped down. The shakeup comes at a time when many of the most visible e-bike brands have struggled, with two —CakeandVanMoof— recently going through bankruptcy restructurings. Rad Power itself is in the middle of a “strategic pivot to support a more significant focus on physical retail, which required downsizing our teams involved in the direct-to-consumer business,” the company said in a statement. “While it is always challenging to make these decisions, we are approaching this transition with empathy and unwavering support for our talented team members and are confident that this pivot will better support our riders and the advancement of our mission going forward.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation At SXSW, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber pokes fun at Mark Zuckerberg with Latin phrase T-shirt ServiceNow to buy Moveworks for $2.85B to grow its AI portfolio Rocket Companies to acquire Redfin for $1.75B Neom is reportedly turning into a financial disaster, except for McKinsey & Co.

Manus probably isn’t China’s second ‘DeepSeek moment’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/manus-probably-isnt-chinas-second-deepseek-moment/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Manus, an “agentic” AI platform that launched in preview last week, is generating more hype than a Taylor Swift concert. The head of product at Hugging Facecalled Manus“the most impressive AI tool I’ve ever tried.” AI policy researcher Dean BalldescribedManus as the “most sophisticated computer using AI.” Theofficial Discord serverfor Manus grew to over 138,000 members in just a few days, and invite codes for Manus arereportedlyselling for thousands of dollars on Chinese reseller app Xianyu. But it’s not clear the hype is justified. excellenthttps://t.co/TfeV9QZ1d0 — jack (@jack)March 9, 2025  Manus wasn’t developed entirely from scratch.According to reportson social media, the platform uses a combination of existing and fine-tuned AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude and Alibaba’s Qwen, to perform tasks such as drafting research reports and analyzing financial filings. Yet on its website, Butterfly Effect — the Chinese startup behind Manus — gives a few wild examples of what the platform supposedly can accomplish,from buying real estate to programming video games. In aviral videoon X, Yichao “Peak” Ji, a research lead for Manus, implied that the platform was superior to agentic tools such as OpenAI’sdeep researchandOperator. Manus outperforms deep research on a popular benchmark for general AI assistants called GAIA, Ji claimed, which probes an AI’s ability to carry out work by browsing the web, using software, and more. “[Manus] isn’t just another chatbot or workflow,” Ji said in the video. “It’s a completely autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution […] We see it as the next paradigm of human-machine collaboration.” But some early users say that Manus is no panacea. Alexander Doria, the co-founder of AI startup Pleias,said in a post on Xthat he encountered error messages and endless loops while testing Manus. Other X userspointed out that Manus makes mistakes on factual questionsanddoesn’t consistently cite its work— andoften misses information that’s easily found online. Deep Research finished in under 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Manus AI failed after 50 minutes at step 18/20! 😑 It was performing quite well-I was watching Manus’ output & it seemed excellent. However, running the same prompt a second time is a bit frustrating as it takes too long!https://t.co/bGtmOI65CP — Derya Unutmaz, MD (@DeryaTR_)March 8, 2025  My own experience with Manus hasn’t been incredibly positive. I asked the platform to handle what seemed to me like a pretty straightforward request: order a fried chicken sandwich from a top-rated fast food joint in my delivery range. After about 10 minutes, Manus crashed. On the second attempt, it found a menu item that met my criteria, but Manus couldn’t complete the ordering process — or provide a checkout link, even. Manus similarly whiffed when I asked it to book a flight from NYC to Japan. Given instructions that I thought didn’t leave much room for ambiguity (e.g. “look for a business-class flight, prioritizing price and flexible dates”), the best Manus could do was serve up links to fares across several airline websites and airfare search engines like Kayak, some of which were broken. Hoping the next few tasks might be the charm, I told Manus to reserve a table for one at a restaurant within walking distance. It failed after a few minutes. Then I asked the platform to build a Naruto-inspired fighting game. It errored out half an hour in, which is when I decided to throw in the towel. Honest opinion after trying Manus AI for the last 3 days, here’s the good and the bad. Good:– The research it does on the internet and the reports it generates are incredible.– Its ability to run scripts behind the scenes to execute tasks is impressive.– The plans it… — AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success)March 9, 2025  A spokesperson for Manus sent TechCrunch the following statement via DM: “As a small team, our focus is to keep improving Manus and make AI agents that actually help users solve problems […] The primary goal of the current closed beta is to stress-test various parts of the system and identify issues. We deeply appreciate the valuable insights shared by everyone.” So if Manus is falling short of its technical promises, why did it blow up? A few factors contributed, such as the exclusivity created by ascarcity of invites. Chinese media was quick to tout Manus as an AI breakthrough;publication QQ News called it“the pride of domestic products.” Meanwhile, AI influencers on social media spread misinformation about Manus’ capabilities. Awidely shared videoshowed a desktop program, ostensibly Manus, taking action across multiple smartphone apps.Ji confirmedthat the video wasn’t, in fact, a demo of Manus. OtherinfluentialAIaccountson X sought to draw comparisons between Manus and Chinese AI companyDeepSeek— comparisons not necessarily rooted in fact. Butterfly Effect didn’t develop models in-house, unlike DeepSeek. And while DeepSeek made many of its technologies openly available, Butterfly Effect hasn’t —at least not yet. To be fair to Butterfly Effect, Manus is in early access. The company claims it’s working to scale computing capacity and fix issues as they’re reported. But as the platform currently exists, Manus appears to be a case of hype running ahead of technological innovation.

"Neom is reportedly turning into a financial disaster, except for McKinsey & Co.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/neom-is-reportedly-turning-into-a-financial-disaster-except-for-mckinsey-co/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Posted: A newWSJ reportsuggests that Saudi Arabia’s now eight-year-old Neom project — a futuristic, carbon-neutral, 105-mile-long linear city envisioned by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — has become a financial sinkhole. Plagued by delays and cost overruns, the country, which has already shelled out $50 billion, could reportedly face another 55 years of construction, with an astonishing projected cost of $8.8 trillion, according to an internal audit presented to Neom’s board last summer. That’s more than 25 times Saudi Arabia’s annual budget, notes the Journal. The situation is starting to resemble Saudi Arabia’s ownWaterloo, with MBS misjudging the monumental challenges inherent in his strategy, much like Napoleon did before him. Among the harsh realities threatening to derail the project are insufficient labor, inadequate roads, and a lack of electricity. There are some winners, however. Consulting giant McKinsey & Company is reportedly earning more than $130 million annually for its services, despite some controversy surround its role, given the firm’s involvement in both the planning and validation of some of the project’s financial projections, per the story. A McKinsey spokesman tells the WSJ the firm has “strict protocols to prevent conflicts of interest in our engagements.” Topics Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

He’d previously reported that the device could be released as soon as March 2025 (so, this month). It would reportedly include a six-inch touchscreen that’s mounted on the wall, could be used for video calls and managing smart home devices, and would be largely controlled by voice.

DeepSeek isn’t taking VC money yet. Here are 3 reasons why.,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/deepseek-isnt-taking-vc-money-yet-here-are-3-reasons-why/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek’s founder Liang Wenfeng is in no hurry to get investment from outsiders, the WSJreportedMonday. DeepSeek is one of the hottest AI startups in the world right now after the Chinese AI companytook Silicon Valley by stormwithits latest modelearlier this year. Unlike DeepSeek’s AI model provider counterparts, who regularly announce mega-rounds filled with prominent investors, Liang hasn’t announced any fundraises, despite lots of VC interest. Rumors about its supposed investors have evenfueled (baseless) ralliesin some Chinese stocks. An analysis of Chinese corporate records by TechCrunch shows that DeepSeek is 84% owned by Liang himself. The rest of the startup is owned by individuals affiliated with Liang’s hedge fund, High-Flyer. That means that unlike most startups, which require outside capital and are thus used to at least some external influence, DeepSeek is basically a one-man show. And Liang doesn’t have the highest regard for VCs’ opinions. When Liang was trying to raise capital in the past, he was put off by VCs’ focus on rapidly monetizing AI as opposed to fundamental research, he said ina 2023 interview with Chinese media. So one big reason why Liang hasn’t said yes to the investors pounding down his door is that he doesn’t want to share control of his company, the WSJ reported. Most startups need capital from investors from the start. But DeepSeek is a unique beast. Liang has been able to fund DeepSeek through High-Flyer’s profits, reducing his need for outside investment. “Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem,” Liangsaid in 2023. As a Chinese company, DeepSeek operates under strict Chinese laws that grant its government broad data access. Concerns over this have prompted DeepSeek bans froma rising number of governmentsand evensome private companies. Those bans could get even worse if DeepSeek accepts funding from a Chinese investor, who face similar issues. The U.S. government has a history of sanctioning Chinese tech companies it says are close to the Chinese government, like telecom giant Huawei and popular dronemaker DJI. That hasn’t stopped some Chinese state entities from approaching DeepSeek for investment, The Informationreported, although there’s no indication DeepSeek has accepted any. This doesn’t mean DeepSeek will never raise outside capital, though. Earlier this month, DeepSeekannounced a (largely theoretical) profit marginfor the first time, signaling a shift toward monetization—something VCs value, but that Liang previouslydismissed. To keep up with other AI heavyweights, DeepSeek will also likely need access to more and better AI chips—the biggest bottleneck on its development, its founder Liangsaid in 2023. Those chips are expensive and heavily restricted in China due toU.S. export controls. DeepSeek’s ability to be self-funding may also be fading. While High-Flyer has done well in the past, some of its flagship funds have underperformed since 2022, the WSJreported. It also doesn’t help that the Chinese government has beencracking downon quant funds like High-Flyer since 2024. While few concrete names are circulating, DeepSeek has already drawn interest from Tencent and Alibaba, according to multiple news reports. DeepSeek didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

There are a few caveats, which Banda freely offers: The company is still scaling production of TAQ, and it has only just begun working on the type of cells that could drop into an EV. Plus, manypromising battery materialshave died on the path to commercialization. But the upside is strong enough that Daqus is emerging from stealth with a $6 million seed round led by Morningside with participation from unnamed individual investors. Daqus’s material replaces the cathode in a lithium-ion battery. In a typical cell, the cathode is made of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) or iron-phosphate (better known as LFP). NMC cells are more expensive, but offer greater energy density and longer range in electric vehicles. LFP cells are cheaper but heavier. U.S. and European automakers have favored NMC for their EVs, but they’ve begun to switch to LFP to cut costs. Problem is, the vast majority of LFP cathode materials are made in China, making them a nonstarter for U.S.-made EVs that want to qualify for tax credits. The material Daqus is working with, bis-tetraaminobenzoquinone or TAQ for short, isn’t made using expensive critical minerals like nickel or cobalt. Instead, it’s made entirely of widely available carbon-based compounds. For the first step in the manufacturing process, the two molecules the company uses are already used to make dyes and fertilizers. “They are absolutely dirt cheap,” Banda said, noting that the company buys small batches at $1 per kilogram. “So you can only imagine what that means when you buy a ton of it.” What’s more, the process used to synthesize a TAQ cathode uses vastly less energy. Making the stuff only requires heating it to 120 degrees C, some 700 to 800 degrees C lower than LFP or NMC cathodes, Banda said. On themanufacturing line, TAQ can be deposited using existing equipment. But there’s another opportunity to cut costs: existing anode manufacturing equipment can also work with TAQ. That would allow battery makers to use water as a solvent instead of NMP, a toxic solvent that needs to be captured and recycled. Altogether, TAQ’s qualities have left Banda feeling confident that the material can undercut the cheapest lithium-ion batteries on the market. “If somebody is saying that LFP batteries are at $50 per kilowatt hour, we would be cheaper than that for sure,” Banda said. “Exactly how much needs to be figured out.” Daqus has been producing coin cells in its lab space in Massachusetts, and its internal tests have shown TAQ to be durable. TAQ-based batteries can be charged and discharged 2,000 times and maintain at least 80% of its original capacity, and they’re stable at high temperatures. Those small batteries also charge at a rate that, when extrapolated to EVs, would enable six minute fast charging. If there’s a caveat, it’s that TAQ cathodes take up more space than NMC, though they’re competitive with LFP. Still, he points out that because the material is lighter, EVs designed around it could also be made lighter and would need fewer batteries overall. That could give TAQ-powered EVs enough range to compete with NMC while being cheaper and lighter. Sports cars might realize the benefits sooner. Weight has been one of the biggest penalties of electrification: It’s incredibly easy to make an EV that’s lightning quick in a straight line, but making one that handles well on a race track? That’s proven to be harder. A lightweight, fast-charging battery pack could go a long way toward making electric sports cars feel special and all cars more efficient. “Lots of car companies in the world are trying to make electric cars,” Banda said. “What’s the difference between a Rolls Royce versus a Tesla? Sure you have better seats, but in terms of the core of the car, it used to be the engine. Now, it seems to be the battery.” Topics Senior Reporter, Climate At SXSW, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber pokes fun at Mark Zuckerberg with Latin phrase T-shirt ServiceNow to buy Moveworks for $2.85B to grow its AI portfolio Rocket Companies to acquire Redfin for $1.75B Neom is reportedly turning into a financial disaster, except for McKinsey & Co.

In a letter sent to affected customers last week, seen by TechCrunch, PowerSchool confirmed that an investigation into the incident has revealed that its network “experienced unauthorized activity prior to December,” which CrowdStrike dated back to at least August 2024. PowerSchool previously said it detected unauthorized access to its systems between December 19 until it discovered the compromise on December 28, 2024. In its report, CrowdStrike said that a hacker used the same compromised support credentials used in the December breach to access PowerSchool’s network between August 16, 2024, and September 17, 2024. The credentials were used to access PowerSchool PowerSource, the same customer support portal compromised in the December breach to gain access to PowerSchool’s company’s school information system (SIS). PowerSource “allows a support technician with sufficient permissions to gain access to customer SIS database instances for maintenance purposes,” according to CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike said it did not find “sufficient evidence to attribute this activity to the threat actor responsible for the activity in December 2024,” because PowerSchool’s log data “did not go back far enough.” However, CrowdStrike’s findings suggest that the December breach of PowerSchool breach could have been prevented if the compromised credentials were changed sooner. When asked by TechCrunch on Monday, PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler declined to say whether the company was aware of this earlier access to its network prior to the release of CrowdStrike’s report. Many questions remain about the PowerSchool breach, such as the total number of individuals affected. PowerSchool has repeatedly declined to provide an accurate figure, thoughreportssuggest that the personal information of more than 60 million students was accessed.

ServiceNow to buy Moveworks for $2.85B to grow its AI portfolio,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/servicenow-buys-moveworks-for-2-85b-to-grow-its-ai-portfolio/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us ServiceNow said on Monday that it has agreed to acquireMoveworks, which develops enterprise-focused automation and AI tools. ServiceNow will pay $2.85 billion for Moveworks in a mix of cash and stock. The former expects the deal to close in the second half of 2025. Bloombergreportedthe deal late on Sunday night. As of June 2021, Moveworks was valued at $2.1 billion. “With the acquisition of Moveworks, ServiceNow will take another giant leap forward in agentic AI-powered business transformation,” ServiceNow president and COO Amit Zavery said in a press release. “Moveworks’ talented team and elegant AI-first experience, combined with ServiceNow’s powerful AI-driven workflow automation, will supercharge enterprise-wide AI adoption and deliver game-changing outcomes for employees and their customers.” Zavery said the deal made sense for ServiceNow because it and Moveworks already have a number of mutual customers, and the two companies’ product offerings are tightly integrated. By folding Moveworks into its corporate family, ServiceNow has an opportunity to build a platform that “combines] ServiceNow’s agentic AI and automation strengths with Moveworks’ […] AI assistant and enterprise search technology,” Zavery said. Moveworks was founded in 2016 by Bhavin Shah, Vaibhav Nivargi, Varun Singh, and Jiang Chen. Shah previously co-founded Refresh, an app that surfaced insights about people in users’ extended social networks (LinkedIn acquiredit in 2015). Nivargi built a business analytics platform calledClearStory, while Singh was a lead product manager at Meta overseeing Facebook feature development. Chen came to Moveworks by way of Yahoo, Google, and Airbnb. Mountain View-based Moveworks came out of stealth in 2019 with an application to help enterprise customers automate high-level IT support. Over the years, the startup expanded its product portfolio to address various lines of business, including HR, finance, and facilities management. The company’s clients include Unilever, Instacart, Siemens, and Toyota, per its website. Prior to the ServiceNow acquisition, Moveworks managed to raise just over $300 million from backers including Tiger Global, Iconiq Growth and Kleiner Perkins. It has more than 500 employees. “Moveworks hides the complexity employees face at work by giving them an intuitive, engaging starting place to search and drive action across any enterprise system,” Shah said in a statement. “Becoming part of ServiceNow presents an incredible opportunity to accelerate our innovation and deliver on our promise through their AI agent-fueled platform to redefine the user experience for employees and customer service teams.” The deal solidifies ServiceNow’s strategy to embrace emerging AI technologies. In January, the companyacquiredCuein, an “AI-native” conversation data analysis platform, to enhance its data processing capabilities. ServiceNow claims its newest AI solutions are the fastest-growing in its history. The company said it had nearly 1,000 “AI customers” as of December 2024, and around $200 million in annual contract value for its “Pro Plus” AI tier. In its most recent fiscal quarter (Q4 2024), Santa Clara-based ServiceNowreported$2.96 billion in subscription revenues, driven in part by AI adoption.

"In defense tech, Lithuania’s sovereign VC fund is one step ahead",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/in-defense-tech-lithuanias-sovereign-vc-fund-is-one-step-ahead/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Europe is waking up to the need to invest in defense, andso are European VCs. But with a painful history of Soviet occupations, Lithuania didn’t wait for the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to reach its third anniversary to commit5% to 6% of its GDPto military spending — and fund defense startups. Lithuania’s sovereign VC fundCoinvest Capitalwas a pioneer in that regard, and it still is an outlier in not requiring civilian use cases. “We were the first in the region [to be] fully authorized to do defense investments back in March 2023,” said Viktorija Trimbel, its managing partner since February 2023. Unlike many Lithuanians, Trimbel is not tall at all. But what she lacks in basketball potential, she makes up for in energy and relentlessness, especially when it comes to advocating for innovation in defense tech to strengthen Europe’s security. Unmanned Defense Systems(UDS), a Vilnius-based company focused on optimizing the “kill chain,” received Coinvest’s largest investment in that domain, but it is not the only one. According to Trimbel, the evergreen fund has invested some €6.8 million (approximately $7.37 million) into aerospace, defense, and dual-use startups since 2023. Compared to thebillion-dollar roundsflooding into U.S. defense tech companies, the amount may not sound very impressive. That’s unless you consider it per capita, something people often urge you to do in this small Baltic country of 2.89 million inhabitants. Co-creation is another notion that Lithuania often emphasizes, as does Coinvest. As its name suggests, the early-stage fund is co-investing into startups with business angels and other VCs. For early-stage deals, it adopted a cappedprofit-sharing structurethat Trimbel is particularly passionate about. As a board member of the Lithuanian Business Angel Network (LitBAN), which now has 324 members, she’s particularly keen to see more smart money flow into the market. While the collective value of Lithuania’s startup ecosystemincreased 39 times in 10 years, the country still lacks an exit as impactful as Skype’s was for Estonia. Still, liquidity events such asVinted’s secondary salehad a drip-down effect, and Trimbel thinks Coinvest can multiply these euros fast. When it exited Interactio after just 18 months, its rules boosted angel investors’ returns from 9x to 34x. “I believe that was one of the factors which facilitated an explosive growth of the business angel ecosystem,” Trimbel said. In defense tech, too, Trimbel champions the success of others in securing capital. Coinvest’s sole limited partner, Lithuania’s national development bank, also provided “major capital injections to other local VCs like BSV Ventures or ScaleWolf, including [the] Lithuanian contribution to the NATO Innovation Fund (NIF),” shecelebratedon LinkedIn. Similarly, Trimbel ispleasedto see governments across Europe embracing the trend of “investing in deterrence and defense to further support competitiveness and resilience of European countries.” That’s a need Lithuania is sorely aware of, often deeply personally. “When I was 18, I saw with my own eyes, Russian tanks killing people. So for us, it’s not a textbook story,” Trimbel said, referring to the 1991’sJanuary Eventsin which the Soviet military attempted to suppress Lithuania’s independence movement. The trauma of Soviet rule that’s deeply ingrained in Lithuania’s collective memory stretches far beyond 1991. “It’s something that every family has experienced one way or another: occupation, deportations, killings. We don’t need to be taught why we need to invest in defense,” Trimbel said. Still, since the war in Ukraine, there’s a renewed sense of urgency and solidarity. The 2025 edition ofRadarom, a public fundraising campaign for Ukraine, collectedmore than €5.6 millionfor drones and anti-drone systems, including from UDS. Trimbel endorsed it, urging, “Support Ukraine NOW … and any other day till victory.” Like nearly all Lithuanians, Trimbel recalls where she was when Russia launched its full-on invasion of its eastern neighbor on February 24, 2022. A few days earlier, she was abroad with her two daughters, and they discussed whether they should return as signs of war amounted — until her youngest daughter pointed out that they had to: They had left the cat. Cat or no cat, Trimbel would likely have returned to Lithuania either way. She points out that her first name, Viktorija, or Victory, is a good match for her relentless personality. Her circle of girlfriends is also up to par: “Instead of going to the bar and discussing a new handbag or a dress or lipstick, we go to the shooting range,” she said with a smile. Of course, not everyone reacts the same way — it’s only human to experience a flight or freeze reflex. In the immediate aftermath of the war, however, she aimed to get others out of this paralysis by encouraging them to take practical steps. One of them was to join volunteering initiatives that have gained steam across Lithuania. The most emblematic organization in that field is the government-backed nonprofit Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union (LRU). While it is dedicated to the defense and strengthening of Lithuania, its activities extend beyond military training: Together with Coinvest and others, it co-organized theFire Shield hackathon, which will return in 2025 for a third edition. That’s the context in which Trimbel is pictured above, together with the Union’s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Linas Idzelis (in uniform) and retired Lt. Col. Valerijus Šerelis, former squadron commander of the special operations forces that thenot-that-random countrysent to support NATO allies in Afghanistan after 9/11. LRU also contributed to civilian response during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Trimbel, who invested efforts into ahelmet-based ventilation protection project. “COVID was a good rehearsal to mobilize society during times of threat,” she said. For her, that threat has now changed, but it is very much real. But even now, Trimbel cares about areas other than defense tech, and so does Coinvest. She spoke enthusiastically of portfolio startupWalk15and its upcoming “Labrador walk,” an outdoors hike with dogs to encourage people to take more steps to be more active — literally. However, as she wrote in a recentLinkedIn post, “no other investment returns will matter if Ukraine will not receive sufficient support from allies and Europe will be invaded further.” As her name and personality suggest, she won’t relent in her efforts to prevent this outcome.

Japan’s service robot market projected to triple in five years,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/japans-service-robot-market-projected-to-triple-in-five-years/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Posted: Faced with an aging population and labor shortages, Japanese businesses are increasingly relying on service robots to supplement their workforce,according to Bloomberg. Research firm Fuji Keizai projects the country’s service robot market to nearly triple by 2030, to ¥400 billion ($2.7 billion). Potentially driving that growth: The Recruit Works Institute projects that the country will face a labor shortfall of 11 million by 2040, while a government-backed institute estimates that nearly 40% of the population will be 65 or older by 2065. To illustrate how robots are filling the gap, Bloomberg points to the country’s largest table service restaurant chain, Skylark, which uses around 3,000 cat-eared robots to bring food to tables. At one of the chain’s Tokyo restaurants, 71-year-old Yasuko Tagawa estimated that half her job now involves some form of robotic assistance. At one point, Tagawa told a robot, “Thanks for your hard work.

It taunts you with its compact, light build that’s small enough to slip into your pocket and take anywhere, and its siren call is so strong that for some reason, we cannot sleep without our phone on our nightstands. As we weatherthe horrors around us, it may occur to you that you would feel calmer and more attentive and balanced if you did not pick up your phone dozens of times a day to doomscroll.It’s messing with our brainsto intersperse our day with glimpses into the most extreme, engagement-baiting TikToks, only to flip over to X or Bluesky and see crushing news headlines. Like any bad habit, doomscrolling is hard to kick. But it’s not hopeless. So how do you stop doomscrolling? We have some ideas about how you can set yourself up for success. First of all, you aren’t the problem. The problem is that our lives have become deeply intertwined with tech companies that are looking to capture as much of our time as possible. If I use my Apple Watch to track a workout, I end up seeing text messages crop up while I’m trying to catch my breath after running up a steep hill. If I go on Spotify to listen to a specific album, I open the app and immediately see recommendations for podcasts and audiobooks that I’m not typically interested in. Or if I download Snapchat solely for a group chat where my friends send pictures of their pets, then each pet picture comes with some advertisement, extraneous push notification, or AR marketing filter that I didn’t sign up for. It’s no wonder that our phones make us feel crazy. I don’t believe that Mark Zuckerberg is sitting in his lair — probably within his “metaverse” — dreaming up ways to personally make my life worse. But it is the inherent nature of consumer tech companies that our attention is what keeps them afloat, and the more we pay attention to them, the happier their investors are, and the stock prices rise, and so on. Even with the knowledge of how these companies operate, it’s still difficult to break our bad habits. I will still open my Instagram account to see what my friend sent me, only to regain my consciousness 10 minutes later after I’ve watched dozens of Reels. For the first several years after Apple introduced the Screen Time feature on iPhones, I chose deliberately not to turn it on — I was afraid of what I might learn about myself. But that fear in itself told me that I have a problem. Knowledge is power, and if we know which apps are sucking up most of our time, then we can curb how much time we spend on them. Here’s how to set screen time limits for specific apps on iOS: Apple’s built-in Screen Time tools are effective, but they’re a bit easy to circumvent; if you’re watching a great TikTok and suddenly get a pop-up that your time is up, you can just tap a button to give yourself another 15 minutes … and then do the same thing after another 15 minutes go by. Some people opt to use third-party apps to motivate them to reduce their screen time, which can address potential pitfalls of Apple’s existing functionality. Here are some apps that are designed to limit your screen time: We rounded up some physical devicesthat can help you stop looking at screens too much. So, you’ve opened TikTok and your screen time limits have denied you access, but now you don’t know what to do. Maybe you’re standing in line at the coffee shop and need a distraction. And sure, in an ideal world, we could simply be bored without spontaneously combusting, but this isn’t an ideal world.

The new land will host infrastructure to complement xAI’s existing Memphis data center. “xAI’s acquisition of this property ensures we’ll remain at the forefront of AI innovation, right here in Memphis,”  xAI senior site manager Brent Mayo said in a statement. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the expansion was related to apreviously announcedlease on a 522-acre site in Memphis. xAI is hungry for AI hardware. According toreports, the startup recently built a second data center in Atlanta with $700 million worth of chips and other equipment. It alsoinkeda deal with Dell to buy $5 billion worth of GPU-packed servers. xAI uses its data centers to train and run its family of AI models, Grok. The company plans to upgrade its primary Memphis-based facility, called Colossus, to 1 million Nvidia GPUs sometime this year, up from 100,000 last year. Some residents have criticized xAI’s continued expansion in Memphis, arguing it will strain the grid andworsenthe area’s air quality. To attempt to win them over, xAI has provided the local utility with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries and constructed a water recycling plant. Partly to fund its AI infrastructure projects, xAI is said to be discussing a $10 billion round of fundraising that would value the company at $75 billion. xAI closed itslast funding round, which topped out at $6 billion, in late 2024.

"Following takedown operation, Garantex invites customers to ‘face-to-face’ Moscow meeting",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/following-takedown-operation-garantex-invites-customers-to-face-to-face-moscow-meeting/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us It has not been a good week for Russian crypto exchange Garantex. Firstly, on Thursday, stablecoin issuer Tetherblocked access to Garantex’s walletsthat held around $28 million of the crypto exchange’s funds. On the same day, an international law enforcement operation led by the U.S. Secret Serviceseized Garantex’s official websites. At the time, Garantex made no mention of this operation in its official Telegram channels; instead, the companyannouncedit was “suspending all services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals.” Then, on Friday, the U.S. Justice Departmentannounced charges against two of the exchange’s administrators, Aleksej Besciokov, and Aleksandr Mira Serda, accusing the pair of facilitating money laundering on their platform on behalf of cybercriminals and terrorists. U.S. prosecutors also said it froze over $26 million in Tether and Bitcoin that were used to facilitate money laundering, which explained what happened with the Tether wallets. As of Saturday, Garantex offered a potential lifeline to its customers — with a catch.  Without acknowledging the law enforcement actions, Garantexpublished an announcementon its official Telegram channel saying it has “developed a solution for blocked assets,” and is inviting customers with a positive account balance “to a personal meeting in our Moscow office,” according to a machine translation. Garatexsaidit will start “face-to-face meetings” in its office as of Monday, and is asking customers to arrive “with the phone to which the account is linked and with access to your email,” because the company “may need to send you confirmation codes,” its announcement read. The company’s request is unusual, in a world that highly values anonymity like the world of crypto. Showing up at the offices of a company that’s been sanctioned by boththe U.S. governmentandthe European Unionposes difficult-to-predict risks to customers, notwithstanding the risk from the Russian government itself, and there’s no guarantee at this point that Garantex will be able to refund customers. It’s unclear exactly how many customers Garantex has, but the exchange has processed more than $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019, according to the DOJ. Garantex likely has a large number of customers, many of which don’t live anywhere near Moscow. Garantex did not respond to a request for comment.

At first glance, it might appear as though she’s following the same playbook that so many women in tech leadership have played before: downplaying her femininity to be taken seriously. The truth is way more interesting than that. What might look like your average black T-shirt is a subtle, yet clearswipe at Mark Zuckerberg, a CEO who represents everything that Bluesky is trying to work against as an open source social network. The Meta founder and CEO has directly compared himself to the Roman emperor Julius Caesar. His own shirt declaredAut Zuck aut nihil, which is a play on the Latin phraseaut Caesar aut nihil: “Either Caesar or nothing.” Graber’s shirt — which directly copies the style of a shirt that Zuckerberg wore onstage recently — saysMundus sine caesaribus. Or, “a world without Caesars.” With the way Bluesky is designed, Graber is certainly putting her money where her mouth (or shirt) is. As a decentralized social network built upon an open source framework, Bluesky differs from legacy platforms like Facebook in that users have a direct, transparent window into how the platform is being built. “If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.” Meanwhile, Meta has alienated users by interfering in how people experience its platforms, and Bluesky has directly benefitted from that. After Meta pushed controversial updates like training its AI on public user posts, or culling its third-party fact-checking programs, Bluesky experienced bursts of user growth. Still, Bluesky has a long way to go if it wants to topple the Roman Empire of Meta. While Graber’s platform is closing in on33 million total users, Meta has3.35 billion daily active usersacross all of its products: Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. For Meta, that’s around 40% of the world’s population. But for a fledgling social network, Bluesky has created enough of a cultural footprint that it’s bound to stick around. Rome was not built — nor was it toppled — in a day. Topics Reporter Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

AvatarOS snags $7M seed round from M13 to build an AI-powered virtual influencer platform,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/avataros-snags-7m-seed-round-from-m13-to-build-an-ai-powered-virtual-influencer-platform/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A few years ago, several startups with a specific focus on digital avatars appeared because of all the metaverse buzz. While that buzz died down, generative AI has given a new life to avatars as it is easier to spin up different virtual identities. Companies are trying out different use cases for avatars, includingD-IDandSynthesiain the enterprise space,Zoomfor meetings,Glancefor fashion,Praktikafor learning, andTikTokandCaptionsin the creator space. However, Isaac Bratzel, who created popular virtual influencers such asLil MiquelaandAmelia 2.0, thinks there is a lack of high-quality avatars that not just look great but have personalized traits. And that thought process led him to buildAvatarOS. Bratzel previously worked in design roles at IPsoft (where he created Amelia 2.0), virtual influencer company Brud (where he created Lil Miquela), and Dapper Labsafter the company acquired Brud. He started AvatarOS after he left Dapper Labs in 2022. The company said it closed a seed funding round of $7 million led by M13’s Latif Peracha with participation from Andreessen Horowitz Games Fund, HF0, Valia Ventures, and Mento VC. AvatarOS is in an exploratory phase to find the right product-market fit. Bratzel noted that the company is aware that customers don’t always want or need what you can do as a company, technologically, or what is cool. As for M13, Peracha said that this is an exploratory round and the opportunity to back a founder who has a robust track record in the avatar space. “We are going to look at the right business model through this round of exploration and have a bit more clarity on the way forward. We think that because of Isaac’s history in IPsoft to Brud, he is clearly the right person to build the business,” he said. He also added that he did part of the due diligence by talking to an avatar of Bratzel to know more about the founder. The founder said that AvatarOS is geared toward making high-end avatars in 3D space rather than catering to a world of click-to-generate content. “One obvious parallel is spam emails. When it is easy to create content, it proliferates everywhere, and you want to have that differentiation from the saturation of content. That’s where we want to be in the avatar space,” Bratzel told TechCrunch over a call. “While there are existing products that have tech for avatar generation, we want to focus on the avatar itself. If you look at Lil Miquela … That is a permanent entity beyond one single project and was able to accrue value over time,” he added. The company is currently onboarding beta users and giving them access to a few existing avatars. The startup is also releasing a simple API that clients can use to integrate avatars with their sites. Bratzel said these organizations can power these avatars with large language models (LLMs) to provide info, and also change things like camera angles and views. AvatarOS currently creates premium and customized avatars for clients themselves. But down the line, it wants to provide more tools for creation and adjustment to clients. Bratzel said the company’s main differentiation would be the way avatars move in their space. “The main thing that is important to us is the humans move in a unique way. Pretty much every avatar solution can create something that might look like you but moves generically. Our view is that humans don’t move in the same way, and we want to recreate that,” he said. The company will use the funding to grow its team and also build out a machine learning-based deformer that is responsible for creating lifelike movements in avatars.

Microsoft has developed its own AI “reasoning” models comparable to models like OpenAI’so1ando3-mini, theThe Informationreports. OpenAI is said to have refused Microsoft’s requests for technical details about how o1 works — stoking tensions between the firms. Microsoft has also developed a family of models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI’s own,Bloomberg reports,and is reportedly considering offering them through an API later this year. Parallel to those efforts, Microsoft is said to be testing alternative AI models from xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek as possible replacements for OpenAI technology in Copilot. Microsoft, which has invested around $14 billion in OpenAI to date, has looked to hedge its bets in a number of ways, including hiring DeepMind andInflectionco-founder Mustafa Suleyman to lead the tech giant’s AI efforts.

Poolside CEO says most companies shouldn’t build foundation models,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/poolside-ceo-says-most-companies-shouldnt-build-foundation-models/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Poolside co-founder and CEO Jason Warner didn’t mince words: He thinks that most companies looking to build foundation AI models should instead focus on building applications. Poolside is an AI-powered software development platform. Warner told the audience at theHumanX AI conferencein Las Vegas on Monday that he doesn’t think anyone who doesn’t think intelligence is the most important commodity in the world — on par with electricity — should be building a foundation model. “If you’re one of those people, if you want to take one side of the fence, you’re a printing press for cash unlike anything we’ve ever seen in the world,” Warner said. “Or if the other side of the fence, you’re basically changing and bending the arc of humanity in a way that we’ve not done before. And I believe that to be true.” Warner added that his company is “literally” going after AGI through software. If someone looks at foundational models as more of a “nice to have” as a way to raise VC cash, the company should just build a wrapper on an existing foundational model instead, he added. With all that being said, however, Warner said he thinks that companies building foundation models can’t just have a foundation model as their product. Instead, that should be a part of their product — especially as the landscape gets more competitive. “In my view, if I’m going to go build this type of business, I’m building on one side, going after intelligence on compute, I need to go after the hardest environment,” Warner said. “You can’t do simple on one side and hard on the other. It doesn’t really make sense, because if you’re going to go for everything, go for everything.” He added that this is why Poolide is going after tough fields like defense and working with the government. But Warner said the company plans to launch a consumer application at some point, too. San Francisco-based Poolside was founded in 2023 by Warner, the former CTO of GitHub and VC at managing director at Redpoint, and Eiso Kant, a serial founder. The company has raised more than $620 million in venture funding and iscurrently valued at $3 billion.

Chevy Silverado EV vs. Rivian R1T: How two EVs handled the iconic Mint 400 off-road race,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/chevy-silverado-ev-vs-rivian-r1t-how-two-evs-handled-the-iconic-mint-400-off-road-race/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Something special went down in the desert outside of Las Vegas this weekend: Two EVs took on the Mint 400 for the first time. Since the Mint 400 launched back in 1969, vehicles in this iconic desert endurance race have been powered by dead dinosaurs. Spectators and race participants alike are used to the smell of race fuel in the air as everything from V8-motivated Trophy Trucks to humble Class 11 stock Volkswagen Beetles fly over jumps, clamber over rocks, and go flat out on the dry lake bed. That all changed in 2024 when a group of pals entered a Rivian R1T and Mint organizer Matt Martelli created an EV Production class. This year, Chevrolet got into the game and entered the Silverado EV ZR2 off-road race truck concept, a modified version of its truck EV. The concept’s reveal comes as Chevy prepares to launch the 2026 Silverado EV Trail Boss, its first off-road-oriented EV variant, this summer. While the Rivian is very much a stock truck save for the upgraded 35-inch BFGoodrich tires, the Silverado EV got plenty of special parts. The longer control arms were taken from the Hummer EV to allow for 13 inches of travel. The air suspension was nixed in favor of dual-coil springs in the front — with a spring rate of 1,600 pounds per inch — and single coil springs in the rear. These don’t have to support quite so much weight and sit at “only” 978 pounds/inch. Hey, that’s what happens when a truck weighs nearly 10,000 pounds. The tall springs and 37-inch BFGoodrich tires mean the Silverado EV race truck sits 15 inches off the ground. However, the truck itself is so big that I originally estimated it to be only 11 or 12 inches high. Such is the power of proportion. Also taken from the Hummer is the tri-motor system, with two motors in the rear and one in the front. Chevrolet says all together they produce 1,100 horsepower and 11,500 pound-feet of torque. Don’t get too jazzed about that torque number, though. Chevrolet is talking about wheel torque, which isn’t the measure the industry usually uses to talk about torque. The company hasn’t given up all the numbers to do the math, but it’s safe to say the motors produce over 1,000 pound-feet of the stuff. Still nothing to sneeze at. Chevy didn’t change the 205 kWh battery. In the street truck, that’s good enough for 440 miles, in theory enough to race all four laps at the Mint 400. However, ride height, tire size, tread, air pressure, and the dirt all take their toll. Tim Demetrio, group manager for Off Road Performance at Chevrolet, told me that in a limited amount of testing, the truck averaged .5 miles/kWh in the dirt. But he didn’t really know how the battery and drive units would react to hard desert racing. The chance to see Rivian and the modified Chevy Silverado EV square off at the Mint was disrupted by a technicality. Although both vehicles did race, they were in different classes. The Rivian competed in the EV Production class; the Chevrolet, as a vehicle that is currently not offered to the public, was in the EV Open class. And each truck was in a class of one. What’s worse, the Rivian R1T got to make two laps of the 73-mile course, the Chevrolet only one lap. It’s common for production vehicles to get fewer laps than the big Trophy Trucks, but I was hoping both trucks would duke it out for two laps to test both efficiency and charging. When I asked Martelli about the discrepancy, he said, “The Rivian has already raced and completed one lap in last year’s race. When we are shepherding in any new class, we try to ease them into it. We don’t want them to fail. That’s not good for anybody. So we try to manage that by giving them a little bit more each time.” As soon as the trucks came off the starting line, I immediately ran to the stock Silverado EV Chevrolet lent me to drive for the weekend. The first pit is at race mile 21, and the initial part of the course is very fast. Teams get to go flat out over a lake bed and through a few sections of whoops and tackle some sandy washes. By the time I got to the first pit, I had missed the truck. The second pit area is a quick drive for chase vehicles, but the Chevy only has to traverse 16 miles of race course. We found a place to park just in time to see the Silverado EV silently zoom around the corner out of the pit area in a cloud of dust. The truck crossed the finish line with a 40% state of charge. That means it averaged .6 miles/kWh — a bit better than the team was expecting. It took the team 2 hours and 10 minutes to complete the course, so their average speed was about 34 miles per hour. Not too shabby for a big ol’ truck. Both driver Chad Hall and co-driver Mark Stielow were in good spirits after the race. “We just cruised,” said Stielow. “No problems at all.” After leaving the Chevy, I hightailed it over to the Electrify America chargers to check on the Rivian. Yes, the Rivian has to charge its 149 kWh battery to make the two laps and luckily there is a 350 kW charger just a mere quarter mile from the race course. The team only has to enter and exit the course at the same point. I arrived at a scene of controlled chaos. The R1T blew an air spring at race mile 50 or so. The team was busy repairing it while the truck charged. Driver Nick Paris told me they arrived at the charging station with 20% state of charge, putting their lap 1 efficiency at the same .6 miles/kWh as the heavier Silverado. He admitted to having a bit of a lead foot, hitting 110 miles per hour on the dry lakebed. “We saw the Chevy in front of us,” said co-driver Brett Rieser. “And we said, ‘Let’s go’ and zoooop!” The Rivian made the pass and the race was on. Charged to 90%, the Rivian left on its second lap. The vehicle blew a front damper but was only down for 15 minutes. The Rivian team arrived at the finish line with a 10% state of charge and despite pushing the truck to 128 miles per hour on the lakebed, their lap 2 efficiency remained .6 miles/kWh. With their charging time-out, it’s tough to get an average speed, but I would put it at a tad slower than the Chevrolet. Chad Hall is, after all, a professional race truck driver. The Rivian team is just a bunch of delightfully nerdy privateers. Regardless, since both trucks finished, both are considered class winners and will take home a first-place trophy. While battery density and charging infrastructure mean these electron-powered rigs won’t be competitive with ICE race cars and trucks, there certainly is room for more EVs to enter the fray to test their charging speed, range, and durability. Ford Performance, when y’all entering the Lightning? Hey, Jeep, how about entering a Wagoneer S next year? Heck, I’d even be in favor of Uncle Elon entering a Cybertruck. GMC can throw in the Hummer, maybe Porsche could field a Taycan Cross Turismo. I helped Volkswagen get the ID4 to the finish line in Baja in the Mexican 1000 a few years ago, so let’s bring that little guy in too. Imagine the spectacle of all these vehicles battling for electric dirt supremacy.

Colossal CEO Ben Lamm says humanity has a ‘moral obligation’ to pursue de-extinction tech,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/colossal-ceo-ben-lamm-says-humanity-has-a-moral-obligation-to-pursue-de-extinction-tech/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The CEO of Colossal, a startup that aims to use genetic editing techniques to bring back extinct species, including the wooly mammoth, assured audiences at SXSW that the company has no plans to create a real-life Jurassic Park — lest there was any doubt. “Modern conservation isn’t working […] and we’re gonna need a ‘de-extinction’ toolkit,” Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said during an onstage interview Sunday in Austin, responding to questions from actor and board member Joe Manganiello. “I think that we have a moral obligation and an ethical obligation to pursue technologies [that] undo some of the things that we [as a species] have done.” Colossal is working to bring back the dodo bird and thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, well as the wooly mammoth, Lamm added. But the de-extinction of dinosaurs wouldn’t be possible due to the lack of usable sources of dinosaur DNA. Dallas-based Colossal, founded in 2023 by Lamm and George Church, has stated that it wants to have woolly mammoth hybrid calves by 2028, which it hopes to reintroduce to the Arctic tundra habitat. The company is also leading a research project to release Tasmanian tiger joeys back to their original Tasmanian and broader Australian habitat after a period of captivity. That vision has resonated with investors. Colossal has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, and it’scurrently valued at $10.2 billion. Colossal has spun out two companies focused on specific applications, including a third that hasn’t yet been announced. Lamm also said he thinks there’s “billions of dollars” to be made from the “re-wilding” of species and carbon sequestration. One of Colossal’s recent high-profile projects isthe gene-edited “woolly mouse,”a mouse species with mutations inspired by woolly mammoths. The mice, which exhibit long, shaggy, tawny-toned fur, were developed using a mix of mammoth-like and known mouse hair-growth mutations. Some experts have expressed skepticism of the new species, arguing that the experiment was more about mouse genetics than a breakthrough in de-extinction. Lamm, however, said the project validated Colossal’s work on wooly mammoth research. “It showed us that, initially, our edits that we were making for the mammoth are the right edits,” Lamm said. Lamm touched on AI during the interview, saying that he believes that the combination of access to computing, AI, and synthetic biology will be the most “dangerous” set of technologies the world has seen. But he also painted an idealistic picture of the future, predicting that synthetic biology advances in particular will lead to cures for cancer, means of removing plastics from the oceans, and the widespread availability of clean water. “We will have true dominion over life, where we can eradicate species that are invasive or we can bring back lost species,” Lamm said, “and I think we’ll also have the ability to engineer plants — not just for food consumption, but you will be able to engineer plants with different types of proteins.” Lamm also said that he anticipates humanity will “achieve longevity escape velocity” in the next 20 years, adding years to the average human life expectancy and making immortality a theoretical possibility. Beyond human longevity, Lamm said de-extinction may require a “Manhattan Project-scale project” to back up endangered species specifically in “bio vaults” to create stem and egg cells. Lamm said he’s talked to “a country that seems excited about it” — without naming any names. On the subject of public sector work, Lamm mentioned that Colossal meets “quarterly” with U.S. government agencies and that the government has invested in Colossal, presumably via grants.

SXSW 2025: What we’re paying attention to,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/sxsw-2025-what-were-paying-attention-to/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TechCrunch will be on the ground at SXSW 2025 — the annual tech, music, comedy, and film conference that kicked off Friday in Austin — in search of the zeitgeist of this AI-centric era. Yup, we’re one sentence in and AI has already made its entrance. And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin — and globally. It’s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be. SXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics — they’ve all had their moment at SXSW. The tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch’s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it’s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship. Deep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability — look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe’skeynote March 11— and transportation. Autonomous vehicles are back, but this time they’re on the road — not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think. TechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We’ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas. Don’t worry, we’ll have a bit of fun, too.

Open social web browser Surf integrates with Bluesky in latest beta,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/open-social-web-browser-surf-integrates-with-bluesky-in-latest-beta/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Surf, thenew app from Flipboard for browsing the open social web, is expanding its support for Bluesky’s social network. On Monday, the company announced a new version of its beta software (dubbed “Blue Wave”) which allows users to log into the app using their Bluesky credentials and then see all their Bluesky feeds in Surf, including their following feed, discover feed, and any of the custom feeds they’ve pinned in the Bluesky app. The new integration will also allow users to access other Bluesky sources when building their own custom feeds — like Bluesky’s Starter Packs, which are lists of recommended followers that people build to help new users find connections. Other Bluesky sources, like Lists and Custom Feeds, are also available as sources. With the addition, Surf becomes an alternative to using the Bluesky app itself, as you’re able to interact with posts from Bluesky’s network by liking, replying to, and reposting them, while likes and replies from users on Bluesky’s app also display in Surf. Explains Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, Surf gives you “seamless access” to anyone posting on Bluesky, Mastodon or Threads. “It’s the social web coming to life and unifying the social web,” he says. Plus, he sees apps like Surf as a good alternative to centralized social media, which is becoming filled with AI-generated content. “The AI overrun is just brutal,” he says. “This is why I really think RSS is so important because it gives you access to all the best YouTube content, podcasts and newsletters from real people. By being explicit about the sources that you choose, and looking at people that you trust and what sources they’ve recommended, it’s the power of human connection to help filter away all the AI slop,” McCue notes. Another new beta feature is a setup wizard that will guide you through the process of creating your own custom home feed in Surf — something the company aims to add to other custom feed creation tools further down the road. Here, you can design your own universal timeline of sorts, by combining feeds from Mastodon and Bluesky, including your following feeds or other custom feeds, like Bluesky’s “Popular with Friends” or “Discover.” The setup wizard will also let you filter out content you don’t want to see in these feeds, like politics. There are even toggle switches to hide posts about Donald Trump or Elon Musk, if you’d prefer a more escapist feed. “A lot of people I’ve personally spoken with are like…I use Bluesky to get away from the news. And I don’t want to read about Elon. I don’t want to hear any politics,” McCue explains. Where Surf already shines is its ability to help you build your own topical feeds that combine posts from across open social networks and other open protocols like RSS. The latter allows you to add sources like news websites, blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels to your custom feeds. For example, one of McCue’s feeds, “Tech Builders and Thinkers,” includes individuals whose accounts are on Mastodon, Bluesky, and YouTube. The idea is to follow the people and the topics you’re interested in, without limiting yourself to a single platform. For now, all feeds are public by default, allowing users to follow feeds that others have built. In time, however, McCue says your feeds will be private so you can pick and choose which ones you want to share more broadly. You can also tweak the design and layout of the feeds you build, setting their cover image and background color, as well as picking which tab is their default. You can have feeds that look more like a Twitter/X timeline by setting them to the “Discuss” view, or if you’d rather have them focused on images, audio, videos, or articles, you can choose other views, like “Look,” “Listen,” “Watch,” or “Read,” respectively. Today, a number ofdevelopers are building TikTok-likeorInstagram-like apps for Bluesky, which change how you view Bluesky’s content by focusing on a particular type of media. With Surf, you can get the same results without the need for a separate app and without limiting yourself to only Bluesky content. The Surf Blue Wave beta update was first demonstrated at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, and will roll out to existing testers. The company will also be letting in a new wave of beta testers with this release. Surf will later exit Apple’s TestFlight testing platform so the app can reach beyond the limit of 10,000 testers that Apple imposes. The company is also working on bringing the currently iOS-only Surf app to the web.  Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Rocket Companies to acquire Redfin for $1.75B,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/rocket-companies-to-acquire-redfin-for-1-75b/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Redfinisbeing acquiredin an all-stock transaction that values the real estate listing platform at $1.75 billion. The acquiring company isRocket Companies, a Detroit, Michigan-based finance and real estate holding firm that owns various brands, including Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Money (formerly Truebill), and Rocket Loans. The combined entity will essentially pool the two companies’ respective strengths in home search services and financing. “Rocket and Redfin’s approaches to lending and brokerage service have always been two halves of one vision to make the whole home-buying process magical,” Redfin CEOGlenn Kelmansaid in astatement. “We want a customer to be able to check her phone to find out what she can afford, see which homes are just right for her, schedule a tour with a local, expert Redfin agent, and get pre-qualified for a loan, all in a matter of minutes.” Founded in Seattle in 2004, Redfin runs a residential real estate brokerage platform for the U.S. and Canadian markets. The self-proclaimed “Amazon of real estate”went public in 2017, and its shares generally traded flat at around $20 in the subsequent few years. But as with many tech companies, Redfin soared during the pandemic, with its stock hitting an all-time high of $96 in early 2021, before plummeting to below $10 for much of the past three years. Redfin’s shares had slipped more than 30% in the past couple of weeks after itsQ4 2024 earnings missed analysts’ expectationsand its current-quarter forecast was considered weak. Rocket Companies, for its part,went public in 2020, and today has a market cap of $31 billion. The company’s proposed bid of $12.50 per share represents a 63% premium over Redfin’s volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the month leading up to March 7, 2025. The offer entails exchanging 0.7926 shares of Rocket Companies’ Class A stock for each share of Redfin common stock, with Rocket Companies’ shareholders owning 95% of the new combined entity and Redfin shareholders owning 5%. While both boards of directors have already approved the transaction, it does still require Redfin’s shareholders to rubberstamp the deal, which Redfin says it expects to happen in Q3, 2025. Kelman, who has led Redfin since 2005, will continue at the helm and report to Rocket’s CEO, Varun Krishna. This article was updated to clarify that Redfin will remain a public company as part of Rocket Companies.

At SXSW 2025, entrepreneur Frank McCourt, whoseProject Libertyis developing open internet infrastructure (and isthrowing its hat in the ringasa potential buyer for TikTok), announced that his organization has been in discussions with internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee about an integration withSolid, hisopen source project aimedat giving people control over their own data. In apanelat SXSW, McCourt shared that his team had “talked to Tim Berners-Lee about Solid,” adding that “Project Liberty is compatible with Solid.” Though he didn’t announce an official partnership, McCourt suggested that discussions were underway on a future collaboration. “We’re debating, or talking, right now about how to incorporate that — him and Solid, his Solid Pods — into the project,” McCourt teased. Berners-Lee, known as thefather of the World Wide Web,announced in 2018 he had been workingwith a small team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to developSolid. He had also tapped British engineer John Bruce to head upInrupt, a startup built on top of the open source project. Inrupt has gone on to launch a privacy platform aimed at enterprises, where people control their data in online storage entities called Personal Online Data Stores, or Pods for short. With similar missions in mind, Berners-Lee has been supportive of Project Liberty’s efforts. He evenbacked its TikTok bid, saying: “This project has my support.

What PowerSchool won’t say about its data breach affecting millions of students,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/what-powerschool-isnt-saying-about-its-massive-student-data-breach/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us We’re only a few months into 2025, but the recent hack of U.S. edtech giant PowerSchool is on track to be one of the biggest education data breaches in recent years. PowerSchool, which provides K-12 software to more than 18,000 schools to support some 60 million students across North America, first disclosed the data breach in early January 2025. The California-based company,which Bain Capital acquired for $5.6 billion, said an unknown hacker used a single compromised credential to breach its customer support portal in December 2024, allowing further access to the company’s school information system, PowerSchool SIS, which schools use to manage student records, grades, attendance, and enrollment. While PowerSchool has been open about some aspects of the breach — for example, PowerSchool told TechCrunch that the breached PowerSource portal didnotsupport multi-factor authentication at the time of the incident — several important questions remain unanswered months on. TechCrunch sent PowerSchool a list of outstanding questions about the incident, which potentially affects millions of students. PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler declined to answer our questions, saying that all updates related to the breach would be posted on thecompany’s incident page. On January 29, the company said itbegan notifying individualsaffected by the breach and state regulators. Many of the company’s customers also have outstanding questions about the breach,forcing those affected to work together to investigate the hack. In early March, PowerSchool published its data breach postmortem,as prepared by CrowdStrike, two months after PowerSchool customers were told it would be released. While many of the details in the report were known, CrowdStrike confirmed thata hacker had access to PowerSchool’s systems as early as August 2024. Here are some of the questions that remain unanswered. TechCrunch has heard from PowerSchool customers that the scale of the data breach could be “massive.” But PowerSchool has repeatedly declined to say how many schools and individuals are affected, despite telling TechCrunch that it had “identified the schools and districts whose data was involved in this incident.” Bleeping Computer, citing multiple sources, reported in January that the hacker responsible for the PowerSchool breach accessed the personal data of more than 62 million students and 9.5 million teachers. When asked by TechCrunch, PowerSchool declined to confirm whether this number was accurate. PowerSchool’s filings with state attorneys general and communications from breached schools, however, suggest that millions of people likely had personal information stolen in the data breach. In a filing with the Texas attorney general, PowerSchool confirmed that almost 800,000 state residents had data stolen. A January filing with Maine’s attorney general said at least 33,000 residents were affected, but this has since beenupdatedto say the number of impacted individuals is “to be determined.” The Toronto District School Board, Canada’s largest school board that serves approximately 240,000 students each year,said the hackermay have accessed some 40 years’ worth of student data,with the data of almost 1.5 million students taken in the breach. California’s Menlo Park City School District alsoconfirmedthe hacker accessed information on all current students and staff — which respectively number around 2,700 students and 400 staff — as well as students and staff dating back to the start of the 2009-10 school year. Not only do we not know how many people were affected, but we also don’t know how much or what types of data were accessed during the breach. In a communication shared with customers in January, seen by TechCrunch, PowerSchool said the hacker stole “sensitive personal information” on students and teachers, including students’ grades, attendance, and demographics. The company’s incident page also states that stolen data may have included Social Security numbers and medical data, but says that “due to differences in customer requirements, the information exfiltrated for any given individual varied across our customer base.” TechCrunch hasheardfrom multiple schools affected by the incident that “all” of their historical student and teacher data was compromised. One person who works at an affected school district told TechCrunch that the stolen data includes highly sensitive student data, such as information about parental access rights to their children, restraining orders, and information about when certain students need to take their medications. A source speaking with TechCrunch in February revealed that PowerSchool has provided affected schools with a “SIS Self Service” tool that can query and summarize PowerSchool customer data to show what data is stored in their systems. PowerSchool told affected schools, however, that the tool “may not precisely reflect data that was exfiltrated at the time of the incident.” It’s not known if PowerSchool has its own technical means, such as logs, to determine which types of data were stolen from specific school districts. PowerSchool told TechCrunch that the organization had taken “appropriate steps” to prevent the stolen data from being published. In the communication shared with customers, the company confirmed that it worked with a cyber-extortion incident response company to negotiate with the threat actors responsible for the breach. This all but confirms that PowerSchool paid a ransom to the attackers that breached its systems. However, when asked by TechCrunch, the company refused to say how much it paid, or how much the hacker demanded. PowerSchool’s Keebler told TechCrunch that the company “does not anticipate the data being shared or made public” and that it “believes the data has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination.” However, the company has repeatedly declined to say what evidence it has received to suggest that the stolen data had been deleted. Earlyreportssaid the company received video proof, but PowerSchool wouldn’t confirm or deny when asked by TechCrunch. Even then, proof of deletion is by no means a guarantee that the hacker is still not in possession of the data; the U.K.’s recent takedown of the LockBit ransomware gang unearthed evidence thatthe gang still had data belonging to victims who had paid a ransom demand. One of the biggest unknowns about the PowerSchool cyberattack is who was responsible. The company has been in communication with the hacker but has refused to reveal their identity, if known. CyberSteward, the Canadian incident response organization that PowerSchool worked with to negotiate, did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions. Following PowerSchool’s release of itsCrowdStrike forensic reportin March, one person at a school affected by the breach told TechCrunch that the findings were “underwhelming.” The report confirmed the breach was caused by a compromised credential, but the root cause of how the compromised credential was acquired and used remains unknown. Marc Racine, chief executive of the Boston-based education technology consulting firm RootED Solutions, told TechCrunch that while the report provides “some detail,” there is not enough information to “understand what went wrong.” One new detail in the CrowdStrike report is that a hacker had access to PowerSchool’s network betweenAugust 16, 2024, and September 17, 2024. The access was gained using the same compromised credentials used in December’s breach, and the hacker accessed PowerSchool’s PowerSource, the same customer support portal compromised in December to gain access to PowerSchool’s school information system. CrowdStrike said, however, that there is not enough evidence to conclude this is the same threat actor responsible for December’s breach due to insufficient logs. But the findings suggest that the hacker — or multiple hackers — may have had access to PowerSchool’s network for months before the access was detected.

What to know about TikTok’s uncertain future in the US and the people who want to buy it,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/what-to-know-about-tiktoks-uncertain-future-in-the-us-and-the-people-who-want-to-buy-it/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Storelast month. Nonetheless, TikTok’s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform’s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of$60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research’s senior vice president, Angelo Zino. To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. The drama first began inAugust 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance. A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarilyblockedTrump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives,in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok.On April 23, 2024,the Senate passed the bill. Shortly after,President Joe Bidensigned the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response,TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws. On December 27, 2024, Trumpopposedthe potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok. In January,the U.S. Supreme Courtupheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19. Although TikTok indeedshut itself downin the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn’t last long. The appcame back onlineless than 12 hours later. The platform noted, “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.” On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. More recently,in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups who are interested in buying the platform,per Reuters. No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon. Below is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok’s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly,Elon Muskis not among them.) The People’s Bid for TikTokis a consortium organized by Project Liberty founderFrank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of The People’s Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach. Supporters involved include: Jesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last month, Tinsley announced a$30 billion all-cash offerto acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations. The story has been updated after publication to include new interested parties.

Scale AI is being investigated by the US Department of Labor,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/scale-ai-is-being-investigated-by-the-us-department-of-labor/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned. That’s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers. The investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it’s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter. The mere existence of an investigation doesn’t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed. Scale AI is based in San Francisco andwas valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then. Osborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more “flexible work opportunities in AI” to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is “overwhelmingly positive.” “Hundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,” Osborne said. Scale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices.Two lawsuits were filedagainst the startup — one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 — from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days. Scale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards. Scale AI’s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by theWashington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving. The U.S. Department of Labor’swebsitesays it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees. For example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Lawreported. Scale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance,attendedDonald Trump’s inauguration in Januarylike many other tech CEOs. More telling, Scale AI’sformer managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump’s nominee as new director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.’s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration. In this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senatehearingon February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn’t respond to a request for comment. U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.

The biggest breach of US government data is under way,https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Operatives working for Elon Musk have gained unprecedented access to a swath of U.S. government departments — including agencies responsible for managing data on millions of federal employees and a system that handles $6 trillion in payments to Americans. During the first three weeks of Trump’s second administration, Musk’s group of representatives — a presidential advisory board known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — hastaken control of top federal departments and datasets, despite questions about their security clearances, their cybersecurity practices, and the legality of Musk’s activities. Whether a feat or a coup (which depends entirely on your point of view), a small group ofmostly young, private-sector employeesfrom Musk’s businesses and associates — many with no prior government experience — can now view and, in some cases, control the federal government’s most sensitive data held on millions of Americans and the nation’s closest allies. The access by Musk’s DOGE team represents the widest-known compromise of federal government-held data by a private group of individuals — and little has gotten in their way. DOGE has acknowledged few details about its ongoing activities. That task has been left to the media, which has reported questionable cybersecurity practices and the breakdown in long-standing cybersecurity norms that risk sensitive government data from being accessed by nefarious actors. Much of DOGE’s work is avoiding oversight and transparency, leaving open questions around whether cybersecurity and privacy practices are being followed. It’s unclear whether DOGE staffers are following the procedures to keep this data from being accessed by other people, or if any other steps are being taken to protect the sensitive data on Americans. So far, the evidence suggests that security is not top of mind. For example, a DOGE staffer reportedlyused a personal Gmail account to access a government call, and a newly filedlawsuit by federal whistleblowersclaims DOGE ordered an unauthorized email server to be connected to the government network, which violates federal privacy law. DOGE staffers are also said to be feeding sensitive data from at least one government departmentinto AI software. Whether DOGE staffers are bad actors misses part of the point. Acts of subterfuge, espionage, or ignorance could produce the same suboptimal outcome: exposure or loss of the nation’s sensitive datasets. For now, it’s worth looking at how we got here. The ease in which DOGE took over the departments and their vast stores of Americans’ data took career officials and U.S. lawmakers by surprise, who continue to seek answers from the Trump administration. Musk’s efforts to take control of the nation’s data stores also privately alarmed cybersecurity professionals, some of whom have spent their careers in government dedicated to securing Americans’ most sensitive systems and data. Questions remain about what level of security clearance the DOGE staff have and whether their interim security clearance gives them the authority to demand access to restricted federal systems. On returning to office, Trumpsigned an executive orderallowing administration officials to grant “top secret” and compartmentalized security clearance to individuals on an interim basis with little to no substantial vetting, a sharp departure from long-established protocols. The confusion over DOGE staff clearances has led to brief standoffs between several career officials at federal departments in recent days. At the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), senior officials were put on leave after standing in the way of DOGE staff to protect classified information,according to the Associated Press. DOGE subsequently gained access to the classified facility at USAID, which reportedly contained intelligence reports. Katie Miller, an adviser for DOGE, said ina post on Xthat no classified material was accessed by DOGE “without proper security clearances,” though details of the team’s clearanceremains unspecified, including how many people were granted the interim secret clearances. Severalsenior lawmakers of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligencesaid Wednesday that they were still seeking answers about DOGE and what clearance its members have. “No information has been provided to Congress or the public as to who has been formally hired under DOGE, under what authority or regulations DOGE is operating, or how DOGE is vetting and monitoring its staff and representatives before providing them seemingly unfettered access to classified materials and Americans’ personal information,” the senators wrote. Within a week of President Trump’s inauguration — andhis executive order establishing DOGE— Musk’s staffers began infiltrating a variety of federal agencies. The U.S. Treasury’s sensitive payments systems, which contain personal information of millions of Americans who receive payments from the government, from tax refunds to Social Security checks, was among the first. DOGE has alsogained accessto the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources department that includes databases on the personal information of all federal workers, and USAJOBS, whichhas dataon applicants who applied for a federal job. Officials at the OPM said they had no visibility or oversight into Musk’s team’s access to its systems. “It creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications,” they told Reuters. DOGE’s activity has led to widespread opposition, including from some Republicans. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who serves as the most senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee,called Musk’s access to sensitive federal payments systems a national security risk, given the conflict of interest over his extensive business operations in China. A group of senior Democrats later saidin a letter to the Treasurythat DOGE’s access to sensitive government data “could irreparably damage national security.” In a post on Bluesky, former Republican strategist Stuart Stevenscalled the takeoverof the Treasury’s systems “the most significant data leak in cyber history,” adding: “Private individuals in the data business now have access to your Social Security information.” The Treasurydefended its move to grant access to the department’s sensitive payments systems, confirming in an unattributed response to Democratic lawmakers that Musk’s DOGE team has access to the Treasury’s banks of personal information on Americans. Tom Krause, the chief executive ofCloud Software Group, which owns Citrix and several other technology companies, is now a senior Treasury employeeserving as assistant secretaryand has control over trillions of dollars in public funds. DOGE has since gained access to multiple sensitive internal systems at the Department of Education, including datasetscontaining the personal information on millions of students enrolled in financial aid. The Washington Post reports that DOGE staffersfed sensitive employee and financial datafrom the department into an AI system to probe the agency’s spending. DOGE staff alsodemanded “access to all” systems at the Small Business Administration, including contracts, payments, and human resources information. Musk’s teamalso reportedly has accessto payment systems within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, andaccess to dataat the U.S. agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid. DOGE is alsoaccessing personnel systemsat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) andplans to access aviation systemsat the Federal Aviation Administration after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffygranted DOGE access. Musk said ina post on Xthat DOGE plans to “make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,” without providing specifics. Later, DOGEgained accessto the Department of Energy’s IT systems, despite reported concerns by officials at the lack of a standard background check on a DOGE staffer. Musk’s staffers also reportedly haveread-only access to datawithin the federal consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. There are untold security risks that come from granting access to the inner data core of the U.S. government to a group of unelected and private individuals with spurious vetting. To name just a couple of things that could go wrong: Accessing the government network from a non-approved computer harboring malware can compromise other devices on the federal network and allow the theft of sensitive government information, regardless of whether it is classified. And the mishandling of personal information on devices or cloud environments that have not met the standards of the government’s top security specifications, or use the strongest security controls, puts that data at risk of further compromise or leak. These are not unlikely scenarios; these kinds of breaches happen all the time. Last year alone sawsome of the biggest data breaches in historycaused bymalicious access gained through the personal devices of company employees, who accidentally installed malware by downloading knock-off software onto their personal computers and not using proper security protections like multi-factor authentication. Any compromise of the team’s credentials or access, or any improper handling of sensitive databases could result in the irretrievable loss, theft, or misplacement of sensitive government data. Perhaps most troubling is DOGE, and its activities, are operating outside of public scrutiny. Officials and lawmakers tasked with government oversight reportedly have no insight into what data DOGE has access to within the government or what its cybersecurity controls or protections are — if any at all. The departmental professionals who have spent much of their careers protecting access to the data stored in these systems cannot do much but stand by and watch as private individuals with little to no prior government experience raid their most sensitive datasets. Technology and privacy lawyer Cathy Gellis,writing in Techdirt, argues Musk and his DOGE team are likely “personally liable” under the U.S. federal hacking law, known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which covers the accessing of federal systems without the proper authorization. A court would still ultimately have to determine DOGE’s activity as “unauthorized access” and therefore illegal, wrote Gellis. There is also the question of how U.S. state governments will respond to the compromise of their residents’ data at the federal level. U.S. states have data breach laws requiring the protection of their citizens’ data, even if the federal government does not. A coalition of more than a dozen Democratic state attorneys general said they willfile a lawsuit to block DOGE accessing sensitive federal government payment systemscontaining personal data on Americans, without providing a timeline. The access also puts relationships with the United States and its diplomatic allies on shaky ground. Allied nationsmay not want to share intelligence with the U.S. governmentif they think the information could leak, spill into the public domain, or otherwise get lost as a result of the breakdown in cybersecurity practices aimed at protecting sensitive information. In reality, the cybersecurity consequences of DOGE’s ongoing access to federal departments and datasets may not be known for some time.

Consumer Reports finds popular voice cloning tools lack safeguards,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/consumer-reports-finds-popular-voice-cloning-tools-lack-safeguards/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Posted: Several popular voice cloning tools on the market don’t have “meaningful” safeguards to prevent fraud or abuse,according to a new study from Consumer Reports. Consumer Reports probed voice cloning products from six companies — Descript, ElevenLabs, Lovo, PlayHT, Resemble AI, and Speechify — for mechanisms that might make it more difficult for malicious users to clone someone’s voice without their permission. The publication found that only two, Descript and Resemble AI, took steps to combat misuse. Others required only that users check a box confirming that they had the legal right to clone a voice or make a similar self-attestation. Grace Gedye, policy analyst at Consumer Reports, said that AI voice cloning tools have the potential to “supercharge” impersonation scams if adequate safety measures aren’t put in place. “Our assessment shows that there are basic steps companies can take to make it harder to clone someone’s voice without their knowledge — but some companies aren’t taking them,” Gedye said in a statement.

Insight VC explains the biggest mistake that keeps founders from raising a big round,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/insight-vc-explains-the-biggest-mistake-that-keeps-founders-from-raising-a-big-round/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Given how much money VCs are pouring into AI startups these days, it may seem like VCs have decided: If it’s not AI, they won’t write a big check. But that’s not exactly what’s happening. Dealmaking at the moment is more nuanced, said VC Insight Partners managing director Ryan Hinkle during a recent Equity podcast. With $90 billion in assets under management, Insight Partners invests at all stages. It’s known to both write huge checks itself and pile into huge rounds. For instance, Insightco-led Databricks’ $10 billion deal in December; participated in Abnormal Security’s$250 million series Din August (led by Wellington Management); and co-led the$4.4 billion PE take-private deal for Alteryxat the end of 2023 with Clearlake. Hinkle, who started as an intern in 2003 when the company was 10 years old, explained how the firm’s check-writing pace has grown. “When I joined Insight, we had raised a cumulative $1.2 billion ever, across four funds. We had put only $750 million of capital into investments at that point. We do more than a billion dollars per quarter today,” he said. “In all of those 10 years, $750 million invested, which is like a good month for us today,” he joked. (Insight just raised$12.5 billion for its XIII flagship fund.) Good, growing companies that are not selling AI as their core technology (for example, last cycle’s darling, SaaS companies) can still raise healthy checks, he said. But the multiples they can expect — value compared to revenue — won’t be as high. Funding rounds are still “30% lower on a multiple of ARR basis than 2019. Forget the 2021 bubble times,” he said. “The stocks are up because the companies’ revenues are up a lot, but the multiples are still lower.” Hinkle likes to call these current times “the ‘great reset’” and says “it’s a super healthy thing.” But there is one big thing founders can do to maximize the deal that growth VCs will offer, and it doesn’t involve just stamping AI all over the company’s marketing materials. It’s much more important and much more mundane: financial infrastructure. While startups entering their growth rounds (Series B and beyond) don’t necessarily need a CIO, they do need systems that show the details beyond recent customer acquisition and its cousin, annual recurring revenue — which has become something of a joke these days. That number came into vogue with the rise of SaaS, when startups would sign multi-year contracts with customers but could only recognize the revenue after it was billed — not allowing them to show their true growth. Today, startups like to take their most recent month of revenue, multiply it by 12 and voila, ARR. What financiers like Hinkle want is for the startup’s leadership to be able to answer everything about the business the way they can about the product: influences on margin, customer retention rates, all the steps from “quote to cash,” meaning from giving customers a quote to being paid. “Can you produce for me an anonymized customer record of all transactions with each customer?” Hinkle asks. This should include both the invoices and some contract details. “And if that takes more than a button push, the question is, ‘OK, where is it all stored? And why is it potentially scattered?’” he said. Often young startups start with a kluged system where invoicing data is in one place, contract specifics somewhere else. Booking data and duration of contracts might even be somewhere else. And no one is reconciling it all. For many, especially those with impressive growth rates, working on these mundane financial systems just never takes priority over adding product features that lead to more contracts. “I totally get it when you’re growing 100% like, spoiler alert, the metrics are good,” Hinkle said. But at some point, he warned, growth will hit the skids, maybe from competitors. “All of a sudden, you’ve got to refine the sales math, the unit math,” he said. ”And if you can’t see it, it’s hard to know which levers you’re affecting.” Founders who haven’t documented the financial minutiae will hurt themselves during the VC’s diligence process — and that will almost certainly result in a hit on check size or valuation. “We’re still in this hangover aftermath of the great reset, post COVID comedown,” he said. “A lot of us were badly burned.” Where once a founder could walk away with a big check from just a good revenue growth chart and well articulated vision of the future, today, “If I can’t see it with my own eyes, it doesn’t exist,” Hinkle said. “So the emphasis on these metrics is heightened.” It’s true that some VCs will overlook that level of diligence and invest anyway, because VCs still get “intoxicated” by fast-growth numbers too, Hinkle admitted. But, he warned, the problem won’t go away. As the company grows and accrues more customers with more transactions, financial governance will get more unwieldy if systems to track and reconcile are not in place. The sooner a founder deals with it, the better the business will be later, he said.

Signal President Meredith Whittaker calls out agentic AI as having ‘profound’ security and privacy issues,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/signal-president-meredith-whittaker-calls-out-agentic-ai-as-having-profound-security-and-privacy-issues/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Signal President Meredith Whittaker warned Friday thatagentic AIcould come with a risk to user privacy. Speaking onstage at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the advocate for secure communications referred to the use of AI agents as “putting your brain in a jar,” and cautioned that this new paradigm of computing — where AI performs tasks on users’ behalf — has a “profound issue” with both privacy and security. Whittaker explained how AI agents are being marketed as a way to add value to your life by handling various online tasks for the user. For instance, AI agents would be able to take on tasks like looking up concerts, booking tickets, scheduling the event on your calendar, and messaging your friends that it’s booked. “So we can just put our brain in a jar because the thing is doing that and we don’t have to touch it, right?,” Whittaker mused. Then she explained the type of access the AI agent would need to perform these tasks, including access to our web browser and a way to drive it as well as access to our credit card information to pay for tickets, our calendar, and messaging app to send the text to your friends. “It would need to be able to drive that [process] across our entire system with something that looks like root permission, accessing every single one of those databases — probably in the clear, because there’s no model to do that encrypted,” Whittaker warned. “And if we’re talking about a sufficiently powerful … AI model that’s powering that, there’s no way that’s happening on device,” she continued. “That’s almost certainly being sent to a cloud server where it’s being processed and sent back. So there’s a profound issue with security and privacy that is haunting this hype around agents, and that is ultimately threatening to break the blood-brain barrier between the application layer and the OS layer by conjoining all of these separate services [and] muddying their data,” Whittaker concluded. If a messaging app like Signal were to integrate with AI agents, it would undermine the privacy of your messages, she said. The agent has to access the app to text your friends and also pull data back to summarize those texts. Her comments followed remarks she made earlier during the panel on how the AI industry had been built on a surveillance model with mass data collection. She said that the “bigger is better AI paradigm” — meaning the more data, the better — had potential consequences that she didn’t think were good. With agentic AI, Whittaker warned we’d further undermine privacy and security in the name of a “magic genie bot that’s going to take care of the exigencies of life,” she concluded.

ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launchin November 2022.What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code withshort text promptshas evolved into a behemoth with300 million weekly active users. 2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from itspartnership with Applefor its generative AI offering,Apple Intelligence,the release ofGPT-4o with voice capabilities,and the highly-anticipated launch of itstext-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race toChinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries,The Guardian has found.They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews andgenerate “entirely positive” summariesby inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method. Microsoft and OpenAI have a veryspecific, internal definition of AGIbased on the startup’s profits, according to a newreport from The Information.The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect. OpenAIreleased new researchoutlining the company’s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used “deliberative alignment” to make o1 and o3“think” about OpenAI’s safety policy.According to OpenAI’s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered “unsafe” questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announcedthe successors to its o1 reasoning model family:o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the “12 Days of OpenAI” event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT. In an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announceda 1-800 number to call the chatbot— even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode — minus the multimodality. OpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply. OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Searchto free, logged in users.Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid userswhen it launched in October.Not only is Search available now for free users, but it’s also been integratedinto Advanced Voice Mode. OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by atelemetry service it deployedto collect Kubernetes metrics. OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could accessa new “Santa Mode” voiceduring December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, “merry and bright,” as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly — more or less like every Santa you’ve ever heard. OpenAI released thereal-time video capabilities for ChatGPTthat it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what’s on a device’s screen through screen sharing. There’s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. ChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbusdenied it in a post on X, saying the “outage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.” ChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we've recovered.https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE Canvas, OpenAI’scollaboration-focused interfacefor writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. Thecompany released Soraas part of its “12 Days of OpenAI” event followingnearly a year of teasing the product. demand higher than expected; signups will be disabled on and off and generations will be slow for awhile.doing our best!https://t.co/JU3WxE5bGl OpenAI has finally released itstext to video model, Sora.The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be “remixed” through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today toChatGPT Proand Plus subscribers (except in the EU). In Monday’s“12 Days of OpenAI” livestream,CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get “unlimited” generations in their “slow queue mode” and 500 “normal” generations per month. There are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. On day one of its12 Days of OpenAI event,the company announced a new — and expensive — subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a$200-per-month tierthat provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI’s models, including the full version of its o1 “reasoning” model. The full version of o1, which wasreleased as a preview in September,can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be “more concise in its thinking” to improve response times. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happenson our live blog.Follow along with us!

At the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT hassurpassed 300 million weekly active users.The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbothit 200 million weekly active usersin August 2024 and just over a year afterreaching 100 million weekly active usersin November 2023. ChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questionsasked about a “David Mayer,”and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it:digital privacy requests. OpenAI is toying withthe idea of getting into ads.CFO Sarah Friartold the Financial Timesit’s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be “thoughtful” about when and where ads appear — though she later stressed that the company has “no active plans to pursue advertising.” Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently saidads would be a “last resort.” A group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail,have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.The companies behind the suit said that OpenAI infringed their copyrights and are seeking to win monetary damages — and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work. OpenAI announced that its GPT-4o model has been updated to feature more “natural” and “engaging” creative writing abilities as well as more thorough responses and insights when accessing files uploaded by users. GPT-4o got an update 🎉The model’s creative writing ability has leveled up–more natural, engaging, and tailored writing to improve relevance & readability.It’s also better at working with uploaded files, providing deeper insights & more thorough responses.

OpenAI denied reports that it is intending to release anAI model, code-named Orion,by December of this year. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that they “don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,” but that leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room. OpenAI has begun previewinga dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT.The company says the app is an early version and is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users with a “full experience” set to come later this year. OpenAI struck acontent deal with Hearst,the newspaper and magazine publisher known for the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, and others. The partnership will allow OpenAI to surface stories from Hearst publications with citations and direct links. OpenAI introduced a new way tointeract with ChatGPT called “Canvas.”The canvas workspace allows for users to generate writing or code, then highlight sections of the work to have the model edit. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Teams, with a rollout to come to Enterprise and Edu tier users next week.

At the first of its 2024 Dev Day events, OpenAIannounced a new API toolthat will let developers build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can’t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. OpenAI is planning toraise the price of individual ChatGPT subscriptionsfrom $20 per month to $22 per month by the end of the year, according to a report from The New York Times. The report notes that a steeper increase could come over the next five years; by 2029, OpenAI expects it’ll charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati announcedthat she is leaving the companyafter more than six years.

OpenAIunveiled a preview of OpenAI o1, also known as “Strawberry.” The collection of models are available in ChatGPT and via OpenAI’s API: o1-preview and o1 mini. The company claims that o1 can more effectively reason through math and science and fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a command or question. Unlike ChatGPT, o1 can’t browse the web or analyze files yet, is rate-limited and expensive compared to other models.

But the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants. OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accountslinked to an Iranian influence operationthat was generating content about the U.S. presidential election.OpenAI identified five website frontspresenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn’t seem that it reached much of an audience. OpenAI has found that GPT-4o, which powers the recently launched alpha ofAdvanced Voice Modein ChatGPT, can behave in strange ways. In a new “red teaming” report, OpenAI reveals some ofGPT-4o’s weirder quirks,like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation. After a big jump following the release of OpenAI’snew GPT-4o “omni” model,the mobile version of ChatGPT has now seenits biggest month of revenue yet.The app pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Appfigures. OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT — butThe Wall Street Journal reportsthat the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it’s takinga “deliberate approach” to releasing it. OpenAI is giving users their first access toGPT-4o’s updated realistic audio responses.The alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024.

OpenAI announced in a blog post that it hasrecently begun training its next flagship modelto succeed GPT-4. The news came in an announcement of its new safety and security committee, which is responsible for informing safety and security decisions across OpenAI’s products. On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPTuntil its launch in November 2022.Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn’t disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund.

Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI’s most recent launch. After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week,OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in “Her.” OpenAI explainedin a blog postthat Sky’s voice is “not an imitation” of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky. We’ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky.

The goal is to have the new toolin place and ready to use by 2025. In a newpeek behind the curtain of its AI’s secret instructions, OpenAI also releaseda new NSFW policy. Though it’s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI — or any generative AI vendor — can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically. In a new partnership,OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow’s APIand will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users —leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest. Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post,are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles “without permission and without payment” to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot. OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe,London’s Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. “Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,”the FT wrote in a press release. OpenAI isopening a new office in Tokyoand has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands. According to Reuters, OpenAI’sSam Altman hosted hundreds of executivesfrom Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use. Premium ChatGPT users — customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise — can now usean updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo.

You won’t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have “slightly more restrictive content policies,” according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear: “The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,” a spokesperson said. TechCrunch found that the OpenAI’s GPT Storeis flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools. In acourt filing opposing OpenAI’s motion to dismiss The New York Times’ lawsuitalleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that “OpenAI’s attention-grabbing claim that The Times ‘hacked’ its products is as irrelevant as it is false.” The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls. At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whetherartists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. ChatGPT’s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to areport from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day. OpenAI released a newRead Aloud featurefor the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. ChatGPT can now read responses to you. On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap “Read Aloud”.

New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge forusing ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure “well above” reasonable demands. ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was givingnonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning. The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAIin an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech willbe used to help employees with work-related tasksand come as part of Match’s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. As part of a test,OpenAI began rolling out new “memory” controlsfor a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won’t erase ChatGPT’s or a custom GPT’s memories — you must delete the memory itself.

An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report. OpenAI has been toldit’s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy’s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven’t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: “We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.” In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers,OpenAI announced it’s partnering with Common Sense Mediato collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT aslacking in transparency and privacy. Aftera letter from the Congressional Black Caucusquestioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI’s board, the companyresponded.

The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed “chatbots impersonating candidates” as against its policy. Beginning in February,Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT’s Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution. After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudanadmitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences“verbatim.”Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI. In a conversation with Bill Gates on theUnconfuse Mepodcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be “fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.” Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024. OpenAI is forming aCollective Alignment teamof researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow. In a blog post, OpenAI announcedusers will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.” Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting. The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT. Snapshot of how we’re preparing for 2024’s worldwide elections: • Working to prevent abuse, including misleading deepfakes• Providing transparency on AI-generated content• Improving access to authoritative voting informationhttps://t.co/qsysYy5l0L — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 15, 2024  Inan unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of “military and warfare.” In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to “harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.” Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs. After some back and forth over the last few months,OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community. To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans — ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team. the GPT store is live!https://t.co/AKg1mjlvo2 fun speculation last night about which GPTs will be doing the best by the end of today. — Sam Altman (@sama)January 10, 2024  Following a proposedban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbotsin the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.” OpenAI published a public responseto The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit. In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.” We build AI to empower people, including journalists. Our position on the@nytimeslawsuit:• Training is fair use, but we provide an opt-out• ""Regurgitation"" is a rare bug we're driving to zero• The New York Times is not telling the full storyhttps://t.co/S6fSaDsfKb — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 8, 2024  After beingdelayed in December,OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Storesometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company’s updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they’re eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI’s update notably didn’t include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront. GPT Store launching next week – OpenAIpic.twitter.com/I6mkZKtgZG — Manish Singh (@refsrc)January 4, 2024  In an email,OpenAI detailed an incoming updateto its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

US charges admins of Garantex for allegedly facilitating crypto money laundering for terrorists and hackers,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/us-charges-admins-of-garantex-for-allegedly-facilitating-crypto-money-laundering-for-terrorists-and-hackers/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.S. Department of Justiceannounced on Fridaycriminal charges against the administrators of the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex for allegedly facilitating money laundering by criminal and terrorist organizations, as well as violating U.S. sanctions. The two administrators are Lithuanian national and Russian resident Aleksej Besciokov, 46, and Aleksandr Mira Serda, 40, a Russian national residing in the United Arab Emirates, who “knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform,”according to the indictmentagainst them. The DOJ said that Garantex “received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking,” and that the exchange processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019. In the indictment, prosecutors accuse Besciokov of personally allowing transactions linked to cybercriminals, including the North Korean-government hackers known as Lazarus Group. The announcement of the indictment came a day after the U.S. Secret Service and a coalition of law enforcement agenciestook down and seized the official websites of Garantex, replacing their contents with a banner featuring the agencies’ logos and announcing the site’s seizure. When TechCrunch reached out to three Garantex email addresses listed on its official page prior to the takedown, our emails were returned as undelivered. Garantex did not respond to multiple requests for comment through its official Telegram channel. Besciokov and Mira Sera are both accused of a money laundering conspiracy, while Besciokov is also accused of conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy, and of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Both face a maximum of 20 years in prison for the money laundering charge, while Besciokov faces another maximum sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and another maximum of five years for conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. It’s unclear if the two have been arrested. Shannon Shevlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, told TechCrunch that the DOJ doesn’t know if Mira Serda has been arrested in the UAE. The two charged Garantex administrators could not be reached by TechCrunch for comment. U.S. prosecutors alleged that Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that their crypto exchange was used for money laundering and actively worked to make that happen even when Russian authorities asked questions. According to the DOJ, when Russian law enforcement requested records at some point related to a Mira Serda account on Garantex, the company provided incomplete information, and “claimed the account was not verified.” “In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents,” according to the indictment. Garantex has been the focus of Western government action for several years. In 2022, as part of a series of actions against Russian cybercrime,the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Garantex, mentioning an analysis that showed that “over $100 million in transactions are associated with illicit actors and darknet markets, including nearly $6 million from Russian [Ransomware as a Service] gang Conti and also including approximately $2.6 million from [darknet market] Hydra.” Also, in 2024, as part of a series of sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine,the European Union sanctioned Garantex, alleging the exchange is “closely associated with EU-sanctioned Russian banks.” According to the DOJ, despite sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated sanctions law by continuing to accept transactions with U.S.-based entities, and also “redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions.” “For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts,” read the DOJ announcement. The DOJ also said that U.S. law enforcement froze over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering. DOJ spokesperson Shevlin told TechCrunch that the department froze a total of 23,034,884.75 Tether and 35.57 Bitcoin on Binance (worth around $3 million as of Friday), amounting to about $26.2 million. Even before these law enforcement actions, Garantex announced on Thursday that it had suspended “all services, including cryptocurrency withdrawals,” afterstablecoin issuer Tether blocked walletsbelonging to Garantex that were holding more than $28 million. “We have bad news. Tether has entered the war against the Russian crypto market,” Garantex wrote on its official Telegram channel in anannouncement. “We are fighting and will not give up! Please note that all [Tether] in Russian wallets is currently under threat. As always, we are the first, but not the last.” After the DOJ’s announcement on Friday, Garantexposted an alert on Telegramabout scammers “pretending to be the restored Garantex exchange or offering to withdraw funds.” “These are all scammers! Their goal is to gain access to users’ personal data, wallet addresses and other sensitive information,” the announcement in Russian read, according to a machine translation of it. The announcement made no mention of the website takedown, nor of the indictments of Besciokov and Mira Serda.

Nirvana keeps on truckin’ with $80M at $830M valuation for its AI-powered insurance,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/nirvana-keeps-on-truckin-with-80m-at-a-830m-valuation-for-its-ai-powered-insurance/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us As the U.S. trucking industrygears upfor the negative impacts of U.S. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada, a startup building a new kind of trucking insurance has raised some money to grow and help truckers weather the changes. Nirvana, an AI-based insurance platform that uses real-time driving telematics and 20 billion miles of truck driving data to build and manage insurance policies for truckers, has raised $80 million in a Series C round of funding. The fresh cash will be used to build more services for fleets and individual drivers. The investment values Nirvana at $830 million post-money, more than double its previous valuation of$350 millionin October 2023. Rushil Goel, Nirvana’s CEO and co-founder, described the round as “pre-emptive” — it was raised following inbound interest rather than the startup needing the cash. The investment comes from three previous backers. General Catalyst is leading the round, and Lightspeed Venture Partners and Valor Equity Partners are participating. The investors are doubling down following decent growth at the San Francisco-based startup. Nirvana said it has premiums under management worth more than $100 million, double from last year. This growth is coming at the nexus of a few trends. The trucking industry is potentially an enormous market for Nirvana and others like it. Overall, the U.S. trucking industry generated revenue of more than $900 billion in 2024, and accounted for 77% of the freight market in the country, according to theAmerican Trucking Association. It employs around 8.5 million people, 3.5 million of whom are drivers, and has some 14.3 million single-axle and combination trucks registered, which makes up about 5% of all motor vehicles in the country. The industry grew 1.6% in 2025, and its revenue is projected to increase to $1.46 trillion by 2035. That was, however, before Trump last month outlined his broader economic policies, specifically his push to institute import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico to raise federal revenue and drive domestic production. “Imposing border taxes on our two largest and most important trading partners will undo […] progress and raise costs for consumers,” the American Trucking Association said earlier this month. “The 100,000 full-time hardworking truckers hauling 85% of the surface trade in goods with Mexico and 67% of the goods traded with Canada will bear a direct and disproportionate impact.” Not only will tariffs reduce cross-border freight, the association added, they will also increase operational costs. The price of a new truck could rise by up to $35,000, it estimated, “amounting to a $2 billion annual tax and putting new equipment out of reach for small carriers.” All of this means trucking businesses now need to be more mindful of costs than ever before. That is where Nirvana is hoping to play a part. It’s also where Nirvananeedsto play a part lest it find itself facing the same problems as its customers. “The tariffs and related supply chain are disruptions that are certainly coming up,” Goel said in an interview. “And of course, in an industry like trucking, which drives 70% of the freight in the U.S., there’s certainly some impact of that to be expected. It’s our new reality.” The company’s platform covers insurance both for fleets (groups of more than 10 “power units”) and non-fleets (1-9 units). Like other new players in insurance, it charges fees based on usage, on a “pay as you drive” basis that also incorporates safety data using telematics from the vehicles plus data logged by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the trucking regulator. That safety data is also part of the company’ssafety analytics product. In addition to this and the underwriting tech that Nirvana claims produces quotes 15 times faster than a traditional insurer, it has also built AI tools that supposedly automate and speed up claims processing. Similar to other legacy markets like industrial technology, trucking has been a ripe area for tech startups over the last several years. Tapping into innovations in areas like cloud computing, AI, fintech and connected vehicles, startups are spinning up new SaaS-based products to help drivers build their businesses and enable trucking companies to run their fleets more seamlessly. Other companies in the space includeLula,SmartHop,Fairmatic, andCloudTrucks. Startups are taking ambitious swings at the trucks themselves, working on electric and autonomous vehicles for the next generation of transportation. Similarly, insurance is in the middle of an evolution. Something similar to the concept of “neobanks” that create a more dynamic user experience on top of legacy infrastructure has played out among insurance startups. They are also tapping into innovations around big data and AI to rethink how services are priced and provisioned. General Catalyst declined to be interviewed for this story, but it’s notable that its biggest bigwig, CEO Hemant Taneja, is leading this round for the firm. “Insurance is traditionally a technologically bereft market, ripe for change. Nirvana is proving a disruptive model, finding rich data at scale and building AI around the complex steps of providing commercial insurance from quote through claims,” Taneja said in a statement. “We’ve been excited to be a partner in their incredible results, and this investment will accelerate Nirvana even further.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.
